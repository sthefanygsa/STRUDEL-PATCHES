# STRUDEL-PATCHES
My Strudel Live patches — explorations in sound design, darkwave, coldwave, glitch, dreamrave, gothic rock textures, 8-bit melodies and experimental electronic music. Inspired by Crystal Castles, Pastel Ghost, Mareux and alternative synth aesthetics. A personal archive of studies, ideas and noisy experiments in live-coded music.
